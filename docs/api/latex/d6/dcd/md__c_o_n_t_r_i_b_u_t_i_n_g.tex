Pull requests are welcome! They may contain additional test cases (e.\+g. to demonstrate a failure), and/or product changes (with bug fixes or features). All product changes should be accompanied by additional tests to cover and justify the product change unless the product change is strictly an efficiency improvement and no outwardly observable change is expected.

In the master branch, all tests should always pass. Added tests that fail should be marked as Skip via {\ttfamily \mbox{[}Fact(Skip = "{}\+Test does not pass yet"{})\mbox{]}} or similar message to keep our test pass rate at 100\%.
